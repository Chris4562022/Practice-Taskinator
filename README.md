# Taskinator


* This webpage is the Taskinator Application.  On this webpage you'll find an application that will assit you in managing tasks that you need to complete.

You’ll be able to categorize your tasks into three sections:

-Tasks To Do

-Tasks In Progress

-Tasks Completed


You’ll also find that you’ll be able to move your tasks from different sections from “Tasks To Do” to “Tasks Completed” as you progress on your tasks.

Should you need to change a task, they can be edited and saved as well.
